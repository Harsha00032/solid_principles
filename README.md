# Solid Principles

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Understanding how to ensure that each class has only one responsibility and how this helps in keeping the code maintainable.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Learning to design classes that are open for extension but closed for modification, allowing for easier addition of new features.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Exploring how to design class hierarchies where derived classes can be used interchangeably with their base classes without breaking the system.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Understanding how to keep interfaces small and focused, avoiding the problem of "fat interfaces" that force classes to implement unnecessary methods.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Learning to decouple high-level modules from low-level details by introducing abstractions, making the system flexible and easy to maintain.
